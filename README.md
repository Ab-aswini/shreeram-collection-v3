## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **Serverless Static Web Application** built for **Shree Ram Collection**. It uses a modern "Git-based CMS" approach, which means verified reliability, zero server costs, and high performance.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (Fast & Optimised)

- **Database:** JSON Files (Stored directly in Git for 100% data safety)

## 🛠 CMS & Admin Panel Capabilities
The Admin Panel is located at `/admin` (e.g., `your-site.com/admin`).

### **What You Can Do:**
1.  **Manage Products:** Add, Edit, or Delete products.
2.  **Upload Images:** Direct upload to the website gallery.
3.  **Edit Site Details:** Change banners, contact info, and promotional text.
4.  **Categories:** Manage product categories dynamically.

### **Reliability & Safety**
- **Data Ownership:** You own 100% of your data. All products are saved as files in your GitHub repository.
- **Backup:** Every change is "Committed" to Git. This means you have a history of every change ever made. You can undo mistakes easily.
- **Uptime:** Since it's hosted on GitHub Pages, the site benefits from Microsoft/GitHub's global infrastructure.
